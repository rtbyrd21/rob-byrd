  <div class="description">
    <p>During my last two years at Coastal Carolina University I had the opportunity to work as the Art Director of the Universities "feature" magazine, Tempo. Tempo was a bi-annual publication intended to represent the voice of the student body. I worked with two Editors each semester to develop a publication from concept to printed publication, with the only guidelines being a budget of around $10,000 each semester. My advisor and design mentor, Paul Olsen, helped me succeed in this role in a very hands-off manner. During my two-year tenure, Tempo won many national awards for design and editorial and turned to a point of pride for the University.</p>

    <h1>Context</h1>
    <p>This issues theme was "The Future". The concept for this cover and contents page was to show the vast amount of interpretations, dreams and ambitions of the student body. For this image I asked hundreds of students around campus to complete the phrase, The Future is.... </p>

    <h1>Scope</h1>
    
    <p>Each of the four issues of Tempo involved creating the publication from initial concept to published product. There were no parameters or restrictions other than content had to be appropriate for the University and we had work with our assigned budget. The position as Art Director helped me grow as a designer tremendously by presenting many challenging layouts concepts and mastering Adobe Creative Suite through practice and necesity to execute. The position also gave me a good amount of experience with project management and working with local printers to determine, binding, paper weight and type.</p>

    <p>Brainstorming for ideas on the theme of Our Generation began with searching for inspiration. The New York Times Magazine College Issue really stood out to me when I first saw it. It's cluttered and has an overwhelming amount of visual imagery, but it works. It stands apart from typical covers, it suits the imagery of a college scene and overall it's very engaging.</p>
<p>
I assume the designer had a similar predicament as I did with Tempo's theme. How do you sum up such a broad topic into an engaging and clear image? </p>

    <p>During my daily browsing of design blogs and websites I come across many striking images. I keep many of these on hand to browse through when searching for inspiration. This quiet, meditative image seemed perfect to counterbalance the chaotic collage that had begun to take shape for the cover.</p>

<p>The key now was to take ownership of this inspiration.</p>

    <p>Banksy is a very intriguing artist. Graffiti which is seen by many as a nuisance has been brought to the forefront of contemporary art thanks in a large part to his work. The technique was the perfect solution to take ownership of the imagery and tie into the concept of our generation. Amongst the chaos of media and events that left their impression on our generation this image would serve as a quiet reflection and mark to say <i>we were here</i>.</p>

    <p>And so the collage began! The editorial team and I decided on a handful of events we felt had left an impression on our generation. I scoured google for newspaper images and began to compile them into a collage that served as more of a textured background rather than giving preference to any certain event.</p>

   <div class="additonal-caption">
    <p>The rest of the process involved tying everything together in photoshop. The contrast between the background and graffiti imagery were balanced and a few additional elements were added to add interest.</p>

<p>The design theme of the cover helped lay the groundword for the rest of the publication and it was echoed throughout.</p>
