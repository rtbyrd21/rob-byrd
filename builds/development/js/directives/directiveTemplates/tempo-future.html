  <div class="description">
    <p>During my last two years at Coastal Carolina University I had the opportunity to work as the Art Director of the Universities "feature" magazine, Tempo. Tempo was a bi-annual publication intended to represent the voice of the student body. I worked with two Editors each semester to develop a publication from concept to printed publication, with the only guidelines being a budget of around $10,000 each semester. My advisor and design mentor, Paul Olsen, helped me succeed in this role in a very hands-off manner. During my two-year tenure, Tempo won many national awards for design and editorial and turned to a point of pride for the University.</p>

    <h1>Context</h1>
    <p>This issues theme was "The Future". The concept for this cover and contents page was to show the vast amount of interpretations, dreams and ambitions of the student body. For this image I asked hundreds of students around campus to complete the phrase, The Future is.... </p>

    <h1>Scope</h1>
    
    <p>Each of the four issues of Tempo involved creating the publication from initial concept to published product. There were no parameters or restrictions other than content had to be appropriate for the University and we had work with our assigned budget. The position as Art Director helped me grow as a designer tremendously by presenting many challenging layouts concepts and mastering Adobe Creative Suite through practice and necesity to execute. The position also gave me a good amount of experience with project management and working with local printers to determine, binding, paper weight and type.</p>

    <p>I've always been inspired by Maya Lin's design for the Vietnam Memorial. It is powerful in many ways, I appreciate the design most for it's simplicity and impressiveness in the sheer number of names. The memorial forces the viewer to consider each one of the names written on the wall and attach a life to it.
</p><p>
The number of drafts and ideas on how to visualize the theme of the future were numerous. The word future means something entirely different to everyone. The predicment was how to show the future, such a broad idea in a way the audience of tempo could relate to</p>
