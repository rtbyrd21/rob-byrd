  <h1>Welcome to my online portfolio. </h1>
  <p>I am a designer and developer working out of Cincinnati, Ohio. I currently focus my efforts on User Experience design and full-stack development. I enjoy finding patterns and connections through principles of visual perception, information architechture and modular development.</p>
<p>I have an undegrad degree in Fine Arts, several years of professional experience as a Graphic Designer and several more as a Web Developer. I operate a small scale letterpress business from my home and am currently pursuing a Masters of Design degree at the University of Cincinnati's DAAP program.</p>
<p>When I'm not designing, coding or printing stuff, I spend as much time as possible with my two children, Kennedy and Holden.</p>
<p>I'm also a huge sports fan, especially Bengals, listen to lots of music (mostly indie), and go to Art Museums whenever possible.</p>
