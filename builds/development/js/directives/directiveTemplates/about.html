  <h1>Welcome to my online portfolio. </h1>
  <p>I am a designer, who also happens to be an full-stack javascript developer. I enjoy creating and crafting enjoyable, aesthetically engaging user-experiences, finding patterns and connections through principles of visual perception, information architecture and modular development.</p>
    <p>I'm currently finishing up my graduate design degree at the University of Cincinnati's DAAP program. I also operate a small scale letterpress business from my home</p>
<p>When I'm not designing, coding or printing, I spend as much time as possible with my kids.</p>
<p>I'm also a huge sports fan, especially Bengals, listen to lots of music (mostly indie), and go to Art Museums whenever possible.</p>
