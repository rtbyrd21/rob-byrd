The redesign and redevelopment of the healing center was a large undertaking and there were many stakeholders involved. The initial plan of progression was to work iteratively and meet with the Board of Directors once a month to review progress and discuss revisions. While this worked well initially, it was quickly realized that there were too many competing, voices and ideas. It was also evident that there wasn\'t a clear target I was designing for. After several months, I took a step back from the project to make sure everyone agreed on the values of the Healing Center and the goals of the site. I also decided that in order to move forward effectively, we needed one decision maker instead of many, this decision maker, the Executive Director, was now my one point of contact for the project progression instead of a half-dozen decision makers. While the Executive Director did not ignore the rest of the board\'s opinions, she had the final decision making ability. From this point on, the project moved forward at a steady pace, the scope was defined and agreed upon.</p> \n    \n    <p>In hindsight, the initial discovery phase would not have just been on my end, from a designers perspective, but would have been a thorough research and discovery phase with client participation. <a href=\"https://vineyardsandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/Rob/healing-center/case-study.pdf\">View Case Study <i class=\"fa fa-file\"></i></a></p>\n    \n    <h3>Calendar</h3>\n    <p>The events calendar is a very important component of the site. Initially a custom calendar was incorporated into the back-end and CMS. Upon further discussion, we realized the majority of events were re-occuring, which would require a good amount of development to configure that logic. Another realization was that the Healing Center already had all of their events in a Google Calendar for staff. I decided that it made the most sense to leverage that calendar. I built on top of the sourcecode for <a href=\"http://fullcalendar.io/\"> fullcalendar.io</a>, which has great integration with Google Calendar, but no mobile version. I also separated their calendar out so that it could be filterable. The end result was a responsive calendar which required no additional work for the Healing Center. They just have to update their Google Calendars as they had been doing and this would be reflected on the site.</p>\n    \n    \n    <h3>CMS</h3>\n    <p>The custom CMS has been a huge success. To quote a Healing Center volunteer, \"Wow this is really easy to use!\" Using desciptive placeholder text as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr\">\"Toastr.js\" notifications</a> helps users know with confidence when a change has succesfully been made. Red and green go a long way, initially an edit button colored red threw a user off, \"It looks like the delete button,\" they said. Keeping in mind that there are colors which are intuitive to users as positive and negative can help guide the user through the interface.</p>\n    \n    <h3>English to Spanish</h3>\n    <p>A feature which the Healing Center was very excited about incorporating was an English to Spanish toggle. This seemed like a lofty proposition, but as my confidence in Angular.js and REST API\'s grew, I realized a solution. The toggle would set a cookie on the browser to true or false. If true (for Spanish), a call stack of functions would execute, one of which would append a \"sp\" to the API url of all HTTP calls. In the back-end the English API was duplicated, with \"sp\" appended to each of them. The user flow would now be exactly they same and thanks to Angular\'s two way binding, the transition was seemless, without any delay or page refresh to the user. The trasition also works seemlessly on the back-end. A caveat to this logic is that the Spanish and English records for each entry must share a url, for example: /about/missions-and-values would pull do a GET request to api/about for english and api/about-sp for Spanish. The only duplicate content between each record is the url \"/about/missions-and-values\". This allows for looping through content and pulling back the Spanish record that has the mathcing URL on toggle.</p>\n  <p>This feature is currently hidden from the user until the Healing Center is able to translate the Spanish content.</p>\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n   \n   \n  </div>\n\n</div>\n</div>");

As part of a Graduate Assistanship I was awarded by the University of Cincinnati, I was hired to extend the development and eventual redesign of the website they had inherited from the Rhode Island School of design.</p>\n  </div>\n  \n<div class=\"wrapper\">  \n  \n  <div class=\"subHead\" scroll>\n    <h1>Context</h1>\n    <p>The website that the university had inherited was built in Python and Django with a mySQL database. It had a responsive design and admin system for entering articles, issues, volumes and authors with a properly normalized databse, but was lacking a much needed subscriber database and online ordering system. There are several hundred subscribers to the journal all over the world, managing their orders had become a large burden on the administrative staff as well fulfilling orders without credit card payment. </p>\n    \n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"subHead col-md-8\" scroll>\n    <h1>Scope</h1>\n    \n    <p>This project was a large undertaking, mostly due to the framework and language it was built in being unfamiliar. There were many front-end and back-end feature extensions which were needed. It was determined that the back-end features, a subscriber database and online ordering system were the top priority and the front-end redesign would follow. Before any coding was done, I began by familiarizing myself with Python, then Django and then the website structure itself. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There are many challenges that come with inheriting a project. Fortunately Django has great documentation. The website subscriber base, shopping cart and credit card authorization were completed over the course of the first two semesters as well as maintenance and enhancement to the front-end. A complete re-design and extension on features on the fron-tnd are planned for the 2015-2016 school year.  \n    </p>\n    \n    \n    <h1 class=\"float-margin\">Responsibilites</h1>\n    <ul>\n      <li>MySQL Database design</li>\n      <li>Custom CMS build</li>\n      <li>Responsive Front-end on Bootstrap</li>\n      <li>Heroku hosting</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"sidebar col-md-4\" scroll>\n<div class=\"additional\"><img src=\"https://vineyardsandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/Rob/visiblelanguage/admin.png\" alt>\n    <div class=\"additonal-caption\">\n    <p>Building the subscriber database, user registration and shopping cart was a challenge of database normalization which encouraged a large overview, strategic approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n    \n \n</div> \n \n</div>\n  \n   <div id=\"technology\" class=\"subHead\" scroll>\n    <h1>Technology</h1>\n    <div class=\"gallery\">\n      <div><img src=\"https://vineyardsandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/Rob/logos/django.png\" alt></div>\n      <div><img src=\"https://vineyardsandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/Rob/logos/python.png\" alt></div>\n      <div><img src=\"https://vineyardsandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/Rob/logos/mysql.png\" alt></div>\n      <div><img src=\"https://vineyardsandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/Rob/logos/html5.png\" alt></div>\n      <div><img src=\"https://vineyardsandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/Rob/logos/css3.png\" alt></div>\n      <div><img src=\"https://vineyardsandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/Rob/logos/git-logo.png\" alt></div>\n      <div><img src=\"https://vineyardsandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/Rob/logos/github.png\" alt></div>\n      <div><img src=\"https://vineyardsandbox.s3.amazonaws.com/Rob/logos/heroku-Logo.png\" alt></div>\n\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  \n\n</div>\n</div>");}]);
